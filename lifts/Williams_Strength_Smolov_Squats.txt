The Smolov Squat Cycle is a 13-week Russian squat routine which is typically classified as an advanced program 
(you don't just do this from the get-go). Definitely one of the most challenging physical things that I've done. 
Some weeks will see you squatting with intensity 4x/week. This is for when you stop seeing gains from other programs, 
and has the potential to add 65-100 lbs to your squat in 13 weeks.
